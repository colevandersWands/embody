/**
 * === PRESET vs GRANULAR RESPONSIBILITY ===
 *
 * This config file defines ALL possible trace events (maximum granularity).
 * Presets (defined elsewhere) create learning progressions by enabling
 * subsets of these options:
 *
 * PROGRESSION EXAMPLE - Understanding Variables:
 *
 * Level 1: "variables-basic"
 *   - Only var/let/const declarations
 *   - Only available/assign/read events
 *   - Mental model: "Variables hold values"
 *
 * Level 2: "variables-hoisting"
 *   - Adds declare event
 *   - Shows var vs let/const differences
 *   - Mental model: "JavaScript reads code twice"
 *
 * Level 3: "variables-tdz"
 *   - Distinguishes declare from available
 *   - Shows temporal dead zone
 *   - Mental model: "let/const have a limbo state"
 *
 * Level 4: "bindings-complete"
 *   - Adds parameters, catch, implicit globals
 *   - Full lifecycle tracking
 *   - Mental model: "Everything that creates a named value"
 *
 * The granular configs below are the "atoms" - presets combine them
 * into "molecules" matching different pedagogical needs.

     *   - implicit: { all false }
     *   - available: true, initialize: true, assign: true
     *   - declare: false (hoisting is "magic" at this level)
     *
     * "scope-aware" preset (intermediate - understands hoisting):
     *   - declarative: { all true }
     *   - implicit: { global: true, others false }
     *   - declare: true (now we explain hoisting)
     *   - Shows TDZ, scope chain
     *
     * "full-bindings" preset (advanced - spec-adjacent):
     *   - All options enabled
     *   - Shows parameters, catch bindings, implicit globals
